LSX Search integrates with FacetWP & allows you to easily display search results with filters.

== Description ==

Allow your users to break down their search results using available filters (a.k.a "Facets"). These are created by the FacetWP plugin, and with the power of LSX Search - we bring these filters to the search results.

The [LSX Search Extension](https://lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/search/) allows you to choose which type of content will be filtered in your global search results, and choose the display of the results.

Powerful search is important for a good website user experience. LSX Search allows you to customise the layout of search results (grid / list), enable or disable specific filters (including post types or pages) and sorting relevance (date / A – Z / price).

LSX Search integrates with the [FacetWP plugin](https://facetwp.com/) which creates the filters for your search results. Users can filter search results by available filters.

LSX Search integrates with WooCommerce, LSX Health, LSX Tour Operators, LSX Projects, LSX Testimonials, LSX Team and LSX Videos.

= Showcase =

A theme is only as good as the websites it creates.

We have built to be powerful, as demonstrated by this showcase of our favourite designs, each one built entirely with LSX and a few recommended plugins, like [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com/), [LSX Blocks](https://www.lsdev.biz/lsx/blocks/) and other [LSX Extensions](https://www.lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/). The free extensions allow you to add team members, client reviews, portfolio, videos and so much more to your website. Each extension is designed fluidly with the LSX theme, no code needed.

= Free Companion Theme =

LSX Team is built to show off the best of the WordPress block editor, but it requires the free LSX theme in the WordPress theme repository as the perfect companion for LSX Blocks - https://wordpress.org/themes/lsx/

= Block Editor Support =

The LSX theme is full compatible with the WordPress block editor. This means you can now make use of the drag-and-drop page builder when creating new pages and posts.

[LSX Blocks](https://lsdev.biz/lsx/extensions/blocks) is an extension with blocks designed to display perfectly with the LSX theme. The blocks plugin extends various WordPress core blocks to be more flexible with the WordPress theme.

The combination of LSX Theme & LSX Blocks gives you a true page builder experience using the WordPress Gutenberg block editor.
